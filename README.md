# The Runout

#### A social network about music, December 18, 2018

#### By Josh Gearheart

## Project Description

#### Name of Project:
_The Runout_, AKA: "Letterboxd... but for music!"

#### Projectâ€™s Purpose or Goal:
It will be an app to log and review album listens, similar to what letterboxd.com is for movies.

#### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

- User can look up an album in the app
- User can log an album as listened
- User can rate and/or review an album
- User can view a profile to see their ratings, reviews, and listens.

#### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources will be used?

- React
- Redux
- Discogs API (This one will need some backup, since I've realized there are some albums that Discogs doesn't have)
- Last.fm API (As a backup for Discogs)
- Sass
- Firebase

#### What are the stretch goals?

- Add user authentication so that more than one user can use the site at once.
- Users can pick a list of favorite albums to display on a profile.
- All recently logged albums will live in a CSS grid with sizing relative to how many times they were listened to.  This will function as the homepage.
- Users can filter the homepage by popularity, only showing albums with more or less than a certain number of listens.
- Users can follow other users to see what music they're listening to.
- Users can make and save lists of albums (such as "Top Ten 70s Albums).
- Users can add albums to a "Listen List" for albums that they're interested in.
- Users can search out albums by artist, label, musician, etc.

#### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

- OAuth
- Maybe something else, but that's not clear yet.
